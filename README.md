# hello-world
My first repository

Hi travelers,
I'm Alice in Wonderland hahahah

This is my first commit following github tutorial on how to creat and update your repository.

I have a degree in control and automation engineering. I have not worked in the field.
I fell in love for coding and now im doing some online courses (and projects) in order to get experience to work with it.
